# Monty Hall Problem
 A game presenting and proving the Monty Hall Problem, a probability problem with a counter-intuitive answer. Both code and the game are in Turkish since this was done as a highschool project.
Note: Both the exe and the image needs to be in the same folder for the program to work properly.
